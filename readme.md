mesh-2.4.2 is currently being used
while the provisioner is mesh-provisioner 2.1.2
mesh is the previous 512-point mesh 2.1.2


mesh 1dcnn cannot be provisioned, it will pop up with gen off model bound to a key, etc., initially suspecting it is a provisioner issue, but not sure what the specific reason is

mesh_1 is an intermediate project that can be ignored
mesh_2.4.2 copy is the standard sample of 2.4.2
